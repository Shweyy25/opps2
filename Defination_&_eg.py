class -A class is a code for creating ojects.Objects have member variables and have behaviour associated with them. 
For instance if we talk about a class dog ,the dog will have certain characteristics ,behaviour, and functionality,so 
all these properties are found in class dog which attributes to all these properties.

object-An object is a collection of variables and functions that do a specific task . Its main task is to define the 
properties of a certain class. Taking the example from above the class dog will have certain properties characteristice 
and behaviour , so these can be termed as an object . 
    
constructor - a certain variable initialized within a class and is common to all the methods that will be used within 
    the class can be termed as a constructor . A constructor can be public private protected. 
    
inheritance - classes having similar properties and functionality .a child class inheriting the properties of the parent 
class in called inheritance. This is a very useful property where one dosent need to write programs with similar
 property we can just write simple code once and inherit the properties from the parent class.
 There are two types of inheritance
multilevel(more than one parent class being called in child class one at a time),  
and multiple inheritance(more than one parent
class being called in the child class more than one at a time)

private -contructor that can be used only within the class that defines them
protected- constructor that is visibles in the class and in sub classes which inherit from that class

Abstraction- Abstracting something means to give names to things, so that the name captures the basic idea of 
what a function or a whole program does. In layman term hiding attributes behind a class and just calling the name or 
if we are not giving direct implemention to access a data.

encapsulation- not letting the user modfy any variable on runtime.It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods
 that work on data within one unit.This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent 
 the accidental modification of data.


polymorphism- the function of the child and parent class is similar but the natures are different is called polymorphism.

overriding- the value function in the parent and child class are similar but on calling the child class the value of
 the similar function getting changed is called overriding
 
package-A python package is a collection of modules. Modules that are related 
to each other are mainly put in the same package. When a module from an external package is required 
in a program, that package can be imported and its modules can be put to use.

module-A Python module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. A module can define functions, 
classes, and variables.A module can also include runnable code. Grouping related code into a module makes the code 
easier to understand and use .
